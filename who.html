        <ul><b><em>WHO NEEDS SECCION?</em></b>
            <li>Section is a platform needed by club owners to be discovered, by ballers in the city to party and chill, by travelers and out of towners to find sports to vibe chill and party, for everyone in the city to find more happy hour sports near them. 
                The logic is, businesses come on SECTION to list the club, post their upcoming events, happy hour, food and drinks specials, Famous nights events, Comedy shows, Concerts and more.
